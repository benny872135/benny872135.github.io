                                    <h3>我的自傳</h3>
                                    <p>I am gentle and kind-hearted, serious and responsible in doing things, and good at communicating and coordinating in teamwork. All of these are thanks to my parents for their daily teachings. There are eight members in my family. My father is currently retired and my mother is a housewife. The family gets along harmoniously. Since childhood, my parents have used strict education methods to allow me to grow up in an environment of self-learning, thus creating an independent attitude towards life.</p>

                                    <p>After completing my studies, I enlisted in the army and served as a financial non-commissioned officer. During this period, I deeply realized the importance of learning, so I asked myself to accept new knowledge all the time, in order to optimize the use of resources in teamwork. After retiring from the army, my first job was an advertising AE. During this period, I completed a special investment promotion project for Friends of the Times and won the best AE, which allowed me to achieve considerable growth in the field of advertising and planning; I studied graphic design in my spare time During this period, in addition to laying down my expertise in business and American editorial work, I also cooperated with my personal career planning. I hope that I can play more in management and have a more complete corporate management background in the future.</p>
                                        
                                    <p>With the end of the first job, I entered the technology industry to start the second work process. I have worked in this job for 22+ years, during which I have experienced many different roles, including Product Management, Marketing Management, Channel Management, Sales Management, Account Management and Project Management, etc., roughly dividing this journey into three parts stage:</p>
                                        <p>BENNY 1.0: Refers to the first 10-year stage. Cooperate with the company's new product introduction and be responsible for the product management and marketing management related to the product. After the product officially enters the market and is exported, assist the internal business to market the product. But because the business has too many products to sell, the company added the role of product direct sales for me to experience. Therefore, three roles must be played at the same time. For the most exciting 10 years in the company.</p>
                                        <p>BENNY 2.0: refers to the second 10-year stage. At this time, the company represents more products, and the performance and sales figures of internal business personnel in this product have been declining. Therefore, the company hopes that my work allocation will be 30% product management and 20% Channel Sales Management and 50% Product Sales Management. And Marketing Management is handed over to newcomers. So I have to look at both the total sales figures for the product and the individual sales figures for that product. This stage is called the stage of racing against numbers.</p>
                                        <p>BENNY 3.0: Refers to the recent 2-3 years. At this time, the products I am responsible for have entered the mature stage of the market, so the company also assigned me to transform into 100% Sales Management. For this reason, I also paid for CCNA courses at my own expense. With the adjustment and change of the company's business strategy, this work process has ended.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Regardless of the work field or the private field, I always stick to the work I am interested in. Once I decide to participate in any affairs, I will definitely go all out. From the experience in business and planning, the operation and management of products are relatively familiar. So product and project management is something I am more interested in doing. The past work performance is based on the attitude of expecting to do our best for each job, in order to be able to work hard towards the goal of group success and make more contributions to the company. I also hope that in the future, I can drive the growth of the enterprise and do my part well.</p>
